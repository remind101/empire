# globalconf

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rakyll/globalconf.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rakyll/globalconf)

Effortlessly persist/retrieve flags of your Golang programs. If you need global configuration instead of requiring user always to set command line flags, you are looking at the right package. `globalconf` allows your users to not only provide flags, but config files and environment variables as well.

## Usage

~~~ go
import "github.com/rakyll/globalconf"
~~~
    
### Loading a config file

By default, globalconf provides you a config file under `~/.config/<yourappname>/config.ini`.

~~~ go
globalconf.New("appname") // loads from ~/.config/<appname>/config.ini
~~~

If you don't prefer the default location you can load from a specified path as well.

~~~ go
opts := globalconf.Options{Filename: "/path/to/config/file"}
globalconf.NewWithOptions(&opts)
~~~
	
### Parsing flag values

`globalconf` populates flags with data in the config file if they are not already set.

~~~ go
var (
	flagName    = flag.String("name", "", "Name of the person.")
	flagAddress = flag.String("addr", "", "Address of the person.")
)
~~~
	
Assume the configuration file to be loaded contains the following lines.

	name = Burcu
	addr = Brandschenkestrasse 110, 8002
	
And your program is being started, `$ myapp -name=Jane`
~~~ go
conf, err := globalconf.New("myapp")
conf.ParseAll()
~~~

`*flagName` is going to be equal to `Jane`, whereas `*flagAddress` is `Brandschenkestrasse 110, 8002`, what is provided in the configuration file.

### Custom flag sets

Custom flagsets are supported, but required registration before parse is done. The default flagset `flag.CommandLine` is automatically registered.

~~~ go
globalconf.Register("termopts", termOptsFlagSet)
conf.ParseAll() // parses command line and all registered flag sets
~~~

Custom flagset values should be provided in their own segment. Getting back to the sample ini config file, termopts values will have their own segment.

	name = Burcu
	addr = Brandschenkestrasse 110, 8002
	
	[termopts]
	color = true
	background = ff0000

### Environment variables

If an EnvPrefix is provided, environment variables will take precedence over values in the configuration file.
Set the `EnvPrefix` option when calling `globalconf.NewWithOptions`.
An `EnvPrefix` will only be used if it is a non-empty string.
Command line flags will override the environment variables.

~~~ go
opts := globalconf.Options{
	EnvPrefix: "MYAPP_",
	Filename:  "/path/to/config",
}
conf, err := globalconf.NewWithOptions(&opts)
conf.ParseAll()
~~~

With environment variables:

	APPCONF_NAME = Burcu

and configuration:

	name = Jane
	addr = Brandschenkestrasse 110, 8002

`name` will be set to "burcu" and `addr` will be set to "Brandschenkestrasse 110, 8002".

### Modifying stored flags

Modifications are persisted as long as you set a new flag and your GlobalConf
object was configured with a filename.

~~~ go
f := &flag.Flag{Name: "name", Value: val}
conf.Set("", f) // if you are modifying a command line flag
	
f := &flag.Flag{Name: "color", Value: val}
conf.Set("termopts", color) // if you are modifying a custom flag set flag
~~~

### Deleting stored flags

Like Set, Deletions are persisted as long as you delete a flag's value and your
GlobalConf object was configured with a filename.

~~~ go
conf.Delete("", "name") // removes command line flag "name"s value from config
conf.Delete("termopts", "color") // removes "color"s value from the custom flag set
~~~
